# Instance

An object created from a class.

In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint or a template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. An instance, or an object, is a specific realization of that class.

- - In simple terms, an instance is just an object.

When we say "instance of a class", we are referring to an object that has been created based on the blueprint defined by that class.
So an instance and an object are essentially the same thing. They are different words used to describe the same concept from different perspectives:

Instance refers to the relationship between the object and its class. It denotes that the object is a concrete realization or instantiation of the class definition.
Object refers to the actual run-time entity itself, with its own state (property values) and behavior (methods).

So in easy words:

- - An instance is an object.
- - An object is an instance of a class.

They are two sides of the same coin. The word "instance" emphasizes the object's relationship to its class, while the word "object" refers to the self-contained run-time entity.

### An instance is nothing but an object created from a class blueprint or definition.
