/*
Constructor:

The constructor method is a special method used for initializing new objects created with the class.
It's called automatically when you instantiate a new object using new ClassName().
You can pass parameters to the constructor to initialize object properties.


Methods:

Methods are functions defined inside the class body.
They define the behavior of class instances and can be called on instances created from the class.
Methods can accept parameters and operate on the instance data using this.
